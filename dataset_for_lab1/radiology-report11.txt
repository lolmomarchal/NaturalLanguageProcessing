                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION: Central venous catheter placement.

 Comparison is made to previous study of one day earlier.

 There has been interval placement of a left subclavian central venous catheter
 which terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and superior
 vena cava. No pneumothorax is identified.

 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. There are bilateral pleural effusions
 and adjacent areas of increased lung opacification as well as lower lobes.

 Note is made of previous mediansternotomy and coronary bypass surgery.

 IMPRESSION: Central venous catheter terminates at confluence of left
 brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. No pneumothorax. 2. Persistent
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung opacities which likely reflect
 atelectasis although infectious process is not excluded in the proper clinical
 setting.
