 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
  51 year old man s/p whipple for adeno-ca of papilla. Now rtn w biliary
  obstruction at biliary anastomosis. S/P PTC [**3-29**]. Please perform CT guided
  biopsy to R/O malignancy.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  CT guided biopsy

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of adenocarcinoma of the papilla, status post Whipple. Now
 with biliary obstruction at anastomosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen
 prior to IV contrast.  Following this, axial images were obtained through the
 abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images were
 created.

 CONTRAST:  150 cc Optiray given due to fast bolus rate of injection.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH AND W/O CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions
 with bibasilar atelectasis.

 There is a biliary pigtail catheter in [**Known lastname **]. There is no evidence of
 intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No focal liver lesions are seen.  The
 remaining portion of the pancreas is atrophic with a dilated pancreatic duct.

 There has been increase in the number of lymph nodes in the paraesophageal,
 celiac, and periportal regions.  One periportal lymph node abuts the hepatic
 artery just as it becomes intrahepatic.

 The 'tumor' which was described on MRI correlates to the hepaticojejunal
 anastomosis.  The portal vein is patent.

 There is a trace amount of ascites.

 Adjacent to the inferior edge of the liver there is high attenuation
 stranding, which is also just adjacent to the hepatic flexure of colon.  This
 may be a small amount of hematoma from recent PTC, or simply colonic bowel.
 Peritoneal deposits cannot be excluded.

 The spleen and adrenals are normal. The kidneys enhance and excrete
 symmetrically and there is no evidence of masses or hydronephrosis on either
 kidney.  Small subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen in a para
 aortic and aortocaval location.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber
 without evidence to suggest obstruction.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 No suspicious osseous lesions are seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Findings consistent with local recurrence with increase in the number of
 celiac, periportal, paraesophageal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
 2. The 'tumor' seen on MRI correlates with the hepaticojejunal anastomosis.
 3. Small periportal lymph nodes are seen adjacent to the hepatic artery and
 therefore were felt not safe to biopsy.
 4. There was some high attenuation material and stranding inferior to the edge
 of the liver which may represent a small amount of hematoma from a recent PTC
 or simply the volume averaging from the adjacent bowel. Peritoneal deposits
 cannot be excluded.
