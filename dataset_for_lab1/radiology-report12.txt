 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
  77 year old woman with h/o diverticuli s/p recent admit with diverticulitis and
  lower GI bleed--CT showed thickening, stranding and paracolic fluid at left
  descending and prox. sigmoid colon worrisome for diverticulitis vs ischemic
  bowel vs hemorrhage into bowel wall. Presents with recurrent LLQ pain,
  diarrhea. Please evaluate for diverticulitis, perforation.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  evaluate for diverticulitis

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diverticulitis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired CT images of the lung bases through the pubic
 symphysis with contrast.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Comparison made to prior CT scan dated [**2145-2-27**].
 There is again demonstrated at the lung bases a 3 mm calcified granuloma at
 the left base but otherwise the lungs are clear. There are no pleural
 effusions. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys are
 unremarkable. Again seen is a large 4 cm gallbladder stone. The gallbladder
 otherwise appears unremarkable. The bowel and upper abdomen appear
 unremarkable. No free fluid is seen.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There has been marked interval improvement in the
 thickened sigmoid colon seen in the prior study. There are numerous
 diverticula and minimal stranding in the sigmoid colon which is likely due to
 clearing residual disease. No free fluid is seen. The kidneys demonstrate
 bilateral symmetrical contrast excretion with the ureters seen to course the
 bladder with no filling defects. The bladder appears unremarkable. No free
 fluid is present. No focal fluid collections are identified.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Bone demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 IMPRESSION: 1) Interval improvement in patient's sigmoid disease as in
 [**2145-2-27**].  There is mild stranding of sigmoid colon which likely is related to
 residua of prior disease but cannot rule out an early diverticulitis.
